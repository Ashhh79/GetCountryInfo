Myelf Akash Kushwaha, 
I'm a Student of BSc Computer Science and I am in the final year.

This is the coding challenge given by DeepThought Edutech Ventures Private Limited

Create a web page to display the details about any country the user searched for.
The page should have a search field.
Initially, the page should show the search field and list of country names sorted alphabetically.
Based on the search term, render the details of the countries.
The details of the country page should contain basic functionalities (example: there must be a google map preview and on click, it should navigate to google maps).
Required data on the page - Country Name, languages spoken, geographic location, Flag(img). You can also form a short description based on the contents you get from the API.
The remaining data can be displayed based on your interest
API Documentation for reference - https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-language
